# Disturbed
>Take this [video](disturbed.mp4) and give me the flag

We are given a [video](disturbed.mp4).

That video is identical to what something like a ethernet would send as a bit stream, the thin peaks are there to synchronise the clocks

![a picture is supposed to be here to explain this more clearly](pic.png)

Then the bit stream was transcribed by hand and [solve.py](solve.py) decodes it, the flag is [sacrilegious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvsvaCU6i1M)

> Flag: please run [solve.py](solve.py) to get flag im not typing it here XD
